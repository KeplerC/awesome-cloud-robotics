A knowledge collection of databases, software and papers related to computational biology.

> Cloud robotics is a field of robotics that attempts to invoke cloud technologies such as cloud computing, cloud 
> storage, and other Internet technologies centered on the benefits of converged infrastructure and shared 
> services for robotics. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_robotics)

> Cloud Robot and Automation systems can be broadly defined as any robot or automation system that relies on 
> data or code from a network to support its operation, i.e., where not all sensing, computation, and memory 
> is integrated into a single standalone system. - James Kuffner
